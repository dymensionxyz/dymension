This directory is for working with AI tools. It has docs, prompts, and other contextual information and tooling scripts.
Note that the copilot instructions live in .github because they have to.

You can use a tool like repomix (https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix, our config is top level) to bundle the information into a tool input. Or you can use off shelf IDE or CLI integrated tools.
