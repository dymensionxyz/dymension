## What is this?

It's a way to setup local Hub + Rollapp and check two things:
    1. Send from Rollapp to Hyperlane and confirm the tokens are escrowed and the outbound message is dispatched
    2. Deliver a message directly to the Hyperlane module message server, and confirm the funds arrive on the Rollapp
