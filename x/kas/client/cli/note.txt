Create ISM (MsgCreateMessageIdMultisigIsmRaw)
Why first? The Interchain Security Module (ISM) acts as the security layer for the mailbox. The Mailbox must be linked to a default ISM at the moment of its creation. Therefore, the ISM has to exist before you can create the mailbox.
Create Mailbox (MsgCreateMailbox)
Dependency: This step requires the ID of the ISM created in Step 1 to populate its DefaultIsm field.
Why second? It's the central component. Both the Merkle Hook and the Warp Token will need to be associated with this specific Mailbox, so it must be created before them.
Create Merkle Tree Hook (MsgCreateMerkleTreeHook)
Dependency: This hook needs to be linked to a specific MailboxId to track its dispatched messages. It cannot be created without a valid Mailbox ID from Step 2.
Create IGP (MsgCreateIgp)
Dependency: The Interchain Gas Paymaster is mostly independent. It doesn't rely on the Mailbox or ISM for its creation. It can be created at any point before it's needed to pay for gas. Placing it here is perfectly fine and doesn't violate any dependencies.
Create Synthetic Token (MsgCreateSyntheticToken)
Dependency: Similar to the Merkle Hook, the Warp Token must be associated with an OriginMailbox. This requires the Mailbox ID from Step 2.
Enroll Remote Router (MsgEnrollRemoteRouter)
Dependency: This is the final link in the chain. Enrolling a router connects a specific token on your chain to its counterpart on a remote chain. This requires the TokenId of the synthetic token you created in Step 5.
